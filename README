Sudoku Solver
----------------

What is this?
--------------
This program will solve a puzzle following the rules of Sudoku. A description of the rules used can be found at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku.

The application impliments a 9 x 9 puzzle using the values 1 to 9.

How does it work?
--------------------
It is a command line application that can take one parameter. The parameter can be a text file with initial values
for the puzzle. The format of the file is as follows:

x y value

Where x and y is in the range 0 to 8 and value is in the range 1 to 9.

Very little verification is done on this file, so I expect many bugs related to this function. It will not detect if an impossible
starting condition has been set.

The application will load the initial state ( if specified ), initialize the rest of the puzzle to random values and then do a search
to find a solution where the conditions of the game has been met.
